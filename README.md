# Rollbots

A 2-player game where you fight against each other.  Every 30 seconds a new
round starts and new bonuses for your attack, defence and power will be rolled.
(Displayed as dice).

Will you keep your distance or go on the offensive?  Each round will force you
to rethink your strategy.

This was our first game, and was made in just 48 hours for the
[GMTK Game Jam 2022][gmtk].  Perhaps the next one will be better...

Built using Godot.
